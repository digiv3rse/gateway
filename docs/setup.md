# Setup Guide

Need help? Contact the Identity team on [Digital/Identity](https://chat.google.com/room/AAAAFdv9gK8).

## Requirements

Make sure you have one or the other or both:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - Version is specified by [.nvmrc](../.nvmrc), run [`$ nvm use`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#nvmrc) to use it.

  - We use [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/) for dependency management, so if using Node, make sure to get yarn too.
  - Node and Yarn are not required if running everything through docker.

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Make sure `docker` and `docker-compose` are available in your terminal.
  - Not required if running everything on your local machine using Node and Yarn.

## Configuration

### Environment File

Populate a `.env` file by using the examples from [`.env.example`](../.env.example). The `.env` file should **never** be committed.

Depending on which stage (`DEV` or `CODE`) you want to connect to [Identity API (IDAPI)](https://github.com/guardian/identity), the `IDAPI_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `IDAPI_BASE_URL` variables will be different. If using the S3 config, it will point to the `CODE` instance of IDAPI.

`PLAY_SESSION_COOKIE_SECRET` should be the `play.crypto.secret` used by [Identity Frontend](https://github.com/guardian/identity-frontend), as found in the `DEV` private configuration. This is used to decode the scala play session cookie, and will only be in use while migration from play is ongoing, and will be removed when migration is complete, or is no longer required.

### Nginx

You can setup gateway to use a domain name locally (`https://profile.thegulocal.com`) and alongside identity-frontend by following the instructions from [`identity-platform/nginx`](https://github.com/guardian/identity-platform/tree/master/nginx).

Using nginx is recommended as it secured with HTTPS and has a domain name allowing cookies to be set correctly, especially as many of the flows in gateway rely on Secure, SameSite=strict cookies.

Nginx will attempt to resolve from gateway first, followed by dotcom/identity second, and finally identity-frontend on the `profile.thegulocal.com` subdomain.

When using nginx, be sure to set `BASE_URI` environment variable in `.env` to `profile.thegulocal.com` which will set the correct cookie domain and CSP (Content Secure Policy) headers.

### S3 Config

You can get a preset `.env` file from the S3 private config. Be sure to have the `identity` Janus credentials.

With dev-nginx (profile.thegulocal.com):

```sh
# IDAPI/Okta pointing to DEV environment (Recommended for development)
$ aws s3 cp --profile identity s3://identity-private-config/DEV/identity-gateway/env-thegulocal-idapi-okta-dev .env

# IDAPI/Okta pointing to CODE environment (Recommended for development against CODE)
# Some cookies may not work due to domain differences
$ aws s3 cp --profile identity s3://identity-private-config/DEV/identity-gateway/env-thegulocal-idapi-okta-code .env
```

Without nginx (localhost:8861):

```sh
# IDAPI/Okta pointing to DEV environment
$ aws s3 cp --profile identity s3://identity-private-config/DEV/identity-gateway/env-localhost-idapi-okta-dev .env

# IDAPI/Okta pointing to CODE environment
$ aws s3 cp --profile identity s3://identity-private-config/DEV/identity-gateway/env-localhost-idapi-okta-code .env
```

## Running

If using nginx, nginx will look for gateway on port `8861`, so be sure to use that port. You can access gateway on `https://profile.thegulocal.com`, nginx prioritises gateway first.

If not using nginx, you can then access gateway on `http://localhost:8861`.

### With Docker

The easiest way to get developing is to use Docker. Development mode can be handled using `docker-compose` using the service name `gateway`.

To start the development server, navigate to the root project folder with the `docker-compose.yml` file and run:

```sh
$ docker-compose up
```

This spins up a container, builds the project with dependencies, and starts the development server on the port defined in the `.env` file. It also automatically restarts the development server on file changes too.

You can run this in the background using:

```sh
$ docker-compose up -d
```

If running the container in the background, you can access logs using:

```sh
$ docker-compose logs -f
```

You can easily run any commands on the container using:

```sh
$ docker-compose run gateway <COMMAND>
# example
$ docker-compose run gateway make test
# or multiple commands
$ docker-compose run gateway sh -c "yarn && yarn build && yarn test"
```

Finally, to directly access the container shell to run commands use

```sh
$ docker-compose exec gateway /bin/sh
```

### Without Docker

It is also possible to run gateway without Docker.

Firstly make sure your running the version of Node given by `.nvmrc`, if you have `nvm` installed, just run `nvm use`.

Next install dependencies:

```sh
$ make install
```

Then to start the development server:

```sh
$ yarn dev
```

This adds the environment variables from the `.env` file and starts the development server.

On the first run/ after removing the `build` folder, you may see errors in your console, this is because the `build` folder and project haven't finished compiling yet, just wait for a while for webpack to finish the bundling process.

Once you see `{"level":"info","message":"server running on port 8861"}` in the console, the application is running.

If your build folder is getting quite large, use `make clean-build` to remove the build folder. Then on the next `yarn dev` command, it will rebuild the application.

## Testing

### Unit Tests

We run unit tests using [`jest`](https://jestjs.io/). Our unit tests are defined in `__tests__` folders spread throughout the `src` directory.

#### Running tests with Docker

To run all the unit tests:

```sh
$ docker-compose run gateway make test
```

#### Running tests without Docker

To run all the unit tests:

```sh
$ make test
```

### Integration Tests

Integration tests are provided by [Cypress](https://cypress.io). They are all defined in the `cypress` folder.

First make sure that the development environment isn't running, since the following scripts will set them up automatically.

You can then open the test runner using:

```sh
$ make cypress-mocked
# or
$ ./cypress-mocked.sh
```

To run the jest tests headless and automatically (how they are run on CI) use:

```sh
$ make ci
# or
$ ./ci.sh
```

## Accessing Gateway on CODE or PROD

To access gateway routes on `CODE` (and `PROD`) alongside the current profile/identity-frontend routes, you'll add the
`GU_GATEWAY` with the value `true` to your cookies.

When you access the `profile.` subdomain, a `GU_GATEWAY` cookie is automatically added with either `true` or `false` value randomly. Make sure the cookie is set to `true` through your browsers developer tools, or alternatively add a `gateway` query parameter to force this to true automatically, examples: `https://profile.theguardian.com/reset?returnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com&skipConfirmation=false&gateway` or `https://profile.theguardian.com/reset?gateway`.

Once this cookie value is `true`, you'll automatically be directed to the `gateway` routes that have been migrated so far.

## Storybook

You can use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)to build UI components and pages in isolation without having to launch the Gateway server or set up routes.

Simply run the following command to start Storybook locally

```sh
$ yarn storybook
```

There's more documentation on setting up a story in the [development documentation](development.md).

When a git branch is updated on GitHub, a "Chromatic Deploy" action is run which publishes the Storybook to a URL.

It also runs [visual regression tests](https://www.chromatic.com/), and the "UI Tests"ยง must pass/be accepted before the PR can be merged. This is used to prevent unintended UI changes from making their way into production.

## IDE Setup

### Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

We recommend using VSCode thanks to it's support for TypeScript and JavaScript, but also for it's extensions that can be shared.

We've included some recommended [extensions](../.vscode/extensions.json) which VSCode will prompt you to install and use on opening this project.

Here's a list of recommended extensions and why we include them:

- [EditorConfig for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=editorconfig.editorconfig)
  - EditorConfig helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs.
  - Uses [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) to override user/workspace settings with settings found in the [`.editorconfig`](.editorconfig) file
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
  - Integrates [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) into VS Code, to provide automatic linting and typescript checking while writing code.
  - Uses rules from the [`.eslintrc.json`](.eslintrc.json) file.
- [Prettier - Code Formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
  - [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules.
  - Rules that we've overridden are found in [`.prettierrc`](.prettierrc), and ignored files in [`.prettierignore`](.prettierignore).
- [Jest](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=orta.vscode-jest)
  - Starts Jest automatically and runs the unit tests when the project is opened. Show individual fail / passes inline. Show fails inside the problem inspector. Highlights the errors next to the expect functions.
  - Also watches for file changes on save, and automatically runs unit tests which rely on code from that file to provide instant test feedback.
- [Visual Studio IntelliCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=visualstudioexptteam.vscodeintellicode)
  - The [Visual Studio IntelliCode](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/intellicode/) extension provides AI-assisted development features for TypeScript/JavaScript in Visual Studio Code, with insights based on understanding your code context combined with machine learning.
  - Essentially provides better code completion from the pop-up completions list by providing context-aware completion.
- [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vsliveshare.vsliveshare)
  - Visual Studio Live Share enables you to collaboratively edit and debug with others in real time.
  - **_THE_** pairing tool.
- [npm Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.npm-intellisense)
  - Visual Studio Code plugin that provides autocompletion npm modules in import statements.
